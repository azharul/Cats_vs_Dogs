## Kaggle Cats vs Dogs challenge using tensorflow
Different implementations of Kaggle cats vs dogs challenge using tensorflow.keras. This is a binary classification problem. Original dataset has 25000 training images and 12500 test images.

**Model**: three layer convnet, each with a maxpool layer, followed by a flatten and a dense layer. Finally a sigmoid layer for binary classification (image available in model folder

**Implementations**
    
    1. No data augmentation, dropout
    2. Data augmentation and dropout (Had to run in google colab as my laptop wasn't able to run it)
